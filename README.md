# facebook-page-event-proxy

This small application is a proxy to retrieve the list of events of a Page on Facebook.

Since Facebook requires an access token to do these requests, it's not possible to do them directly from the browser without exposing an application secret.

## Usage

- Insert your application's ID and secret on `appConfig.json`

- `coffee start.coffee`
